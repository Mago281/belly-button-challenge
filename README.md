## Background

________________________________________

I have been tasked to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

________________________________________


1.  Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.


2.  Created a bubble chart that displayed each sample.

   
3.  Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.


4.  Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object on the page


5.  Ensured that all the plots would be updated each time a new sample is selected.
6.
